# Simple Snake game built with Rust and Tetra
This is a simple snake game that was developed in the Rust Language leveraging the framework [Tetra].

The code should work just fine on several different platforms (Windows and MacOS have been tested), feel free to give feedback if that isn't the case.

Also, if you are interested and learning some game development basics, I have written a [10 step tutorial] on how to build this game pretty much from scratch.
